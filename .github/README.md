3. **Attractive Visual Presentation:**
   - Highlight your work with high-quality images. Make sure that projects are presented in a visually attractive way, with clear and concise standards.

4. **Relevant Content:**
   - Carefully select the projects to be displayed. Prioritize work that demonstrates your specificities and skills relevant to the services you offer.

5. **"About Me" Section:**
   - Include a section that tells a little about yourself, your story, your passions and your approach to design. This allows visitors to get to know a person behind the creations.

6. **Contact Information:**
   - Provide clear contact information. This may include a contact form, email, and links to your professional social networks.
   
### Required Elements:

1. **Diversified Portfolio:**
   - Present a variety of projects to showcase your breadth of skills. This includes different styles, media types, and design contexts.

2. **Project Stories:**
   - For each project, share insights into the design process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented. This provides context and highlights your analytical skills.

3. **Call-to-Action:**
   - Include a clear call to action, inviting visitors to get in touch, request quotes, or explore more of your work.

4. **Testimonials or Recommendations:**
   - If possible, add testimonials from previous customers. This helps build trust and credibility.

5. **Blog or Articles (Optional):**
   - If you enjoy writing about design, consider including a blog or articles section. This not only shows your knowledge but also improves your websiteâ€™s SEO.

6. **Regular Updates:**
   - Keep your portfolio up to date with your latest projects. This demonstrates that you are active and continually evolving as a professional.

7. **Links to Professional Social Networks:**
   - Include links to your accounts on professional platforms like LinkedIn or Behance for a more comprehensive view of your work.

8. **Resume (Optional):**
   - Provide a link to your resume or a section that highlights your experience, education and key skills.

Remember, quality is more important than quantity. Carefully select what to include to create a portfolio that is impressive, informative, and truly reflects who you are as a creative professional.
